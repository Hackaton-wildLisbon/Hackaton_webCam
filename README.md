#### About Wild Winds App
We used ReactJS to create this app that is connected to the Windy API (https://api.windy.com/). The idea was to create an app that allows the user to check webcams around the world. The user can choose a country and then a location in the chosen country. After choosing the location a webcam will load and show the video of the place. 

#### The Hackathon
